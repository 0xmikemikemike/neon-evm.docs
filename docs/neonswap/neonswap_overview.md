# Neonswap overview

*The Neonswap is open source service being fork of [Uniswap V2](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2) and adapted to Neon EVM.*  

Uniswap is an open-source dApp used on Ethereum. In Ethereum, exchanging some tokens for others requires deploying contracts. We want to demonstrate that our Neon EVM product allows you to port the Uniswap service from Ethereum to Solana. To do this, we deploy the complete Uniswap infrastructure, including contracts in our Neon EVM, as well as the uniswap-interface on a separate server. Using the uniswap service deployed on Neon EVM, users can make transactions in their usual form and make sure that Neon EVM is functioning successfully. No changes to the Uniswap product are required to port applications using the Neonswap service.  

> The **Neonswap** service provides an opportunity for Ethereum users to migrate their applications to Neon EVM without any difficulties.
